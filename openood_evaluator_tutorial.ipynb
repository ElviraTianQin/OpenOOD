    "In this notebook, we will showcase how to use OpenOOD's unified evaluator to easily evaluate OOD detection performance w.r.t. a certain ID dataset (e.g., CIFAR-10, ImageNet-1K), given a trained base classifier (e.g., ResNet) and a postprocessor (e.g., MSP, ReAct). Here we use CIFAR-10 as an example (due to speed concern), yet this tutorial also generalizes to larger datasets including ImageNet-1K. **Remember to use GPU in Edit / Notebook settings.**"
